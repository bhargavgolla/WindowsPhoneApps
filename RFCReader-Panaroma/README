RFC Reader
==========

Inspired from this app on Android Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vindroidapps.RFCBook#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLnZpbmRyb2lkYXBwcy5SRkNCb29rIl0.) This app lets users open an RFC document in a minibrowser. It also stores the details of searches that have been made in that session in a Panaroma Control.
